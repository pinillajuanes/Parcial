                            <h3 class="tm-gold-text">Why is social media is causing body dismorphia among it's users?</h3>
                            <p>Comparing your physique with one that may not even exist</p>
                            <img src="img/tm-img-1010x336-1.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid tm-img-post">
                            
                            <p>Numbers don't lie. In the last few years, the number of social media users has been increasing exponentially. More people can access the internet, as well as we learn to interact with it at a younger age. This makes it so many people around the globe can share their thoughts, communicate with their loved ones, and consume content about the topics they love, among many other things.</p>

                            <p>This may sound great at first, but with all the good things that social media has to offer, there is also a dark side, which is frequently just ignored, and some people are not mindful of it.</p>

                            <p>I am talking about the unrealistic body standards that social media has implanted in our society. There are millions of factors that can make your physique look way better. First of all, we have some obvious ones, like steroid use or surgeries, which are way more common than many people think. Many celebrities may have gotten their results from the "S Juice" Some examples include Chris Hemsworth (Thor) or Dwayne Johnson (The Rock).</p>

                            <p>There are then, another factors that can make someone look better in a picture than it is in real life, some of them include good lighting, camera angles, a pump (increasing blood flow to the muscles trough exercise to make them look bigger temporarily), proper posing, editing pictures in post production, etc.</p>

                            <p>The effect that this causes is that, when people see these pictures on their social media feeds, they expect this types of bodies to be the norm, and they ofter don't know that sometimes they are not even real.</p>

                            <p>The best we can do is that we can be aware about all these filters that pictures can go trough with social media. Try to be the best version of yourself, still try to build a good physique, but don't compare your results to people you see in social media, you should only compare your current results with your results from the past.</p>
